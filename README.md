# Quote Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random quotes and displays them on the screen. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Generate random quotes with the click of a button
- Automatic refreshing of quotes every 30 seconds
- Dynamic background color for a visually appealing experience

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- Click the "Load Quote" button to generate a random quote.
- The quote will be displayed in the quote box along with the source of the quote.
- The background color of the page will change randomly each time a new quote is displayed.
- The quote will automatically refresh every 30 seconds.

## Customization

- To modify the list of quotes, open the `script.js` file and update the `quotes` array with your desired quotes. Each quote object should have properties for `quote` (the quote text) and `source` (the source of the quote). Additional properties like `citation` and `year` can be added if applicable.

- To customize the styles, you can modify the `styles.css` file according to your design preferences. Feel free to add additional CSS rules to enhance the visual presentation.
